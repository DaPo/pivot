# vanilla-hover3d
port of jquery-hover3d to vanilla JS

this is a port of [ariona]()'s [excellent jQuery hover3d plugin](https://github.com/ariona/hover3d) for animating elements in 3D space.

I made this mostly because I don't like using jQuery.

The implementation differs slightly, and more control has been added.
